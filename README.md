# ChatGPT-Coding
A database of small programs written by GPT-4 or ChatGPT.

These programs are mostly written in C++ and are not compiled. You will need to compile them yourself or run them on an IDE like Visual Studio of CXX.

I had very little say in the programming other than feature requesting, slight bug fixing, and general maintenance, like erroneous semicolons or closing braces. Therefore, I do not make claim to the programs as my own property, other than intellectually. Nothing here represents my skill (and drastic lack thereof) or property.

ChatGPT and GPT-4 belong to OpenAI.
